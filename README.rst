Why did I start to develop this?
================================

One day, I was using Evernote to store photo of my notebook. I had found:

* Paper is good for writing.
* Tablet is good for storing and viewing.

But I do not want to:

* upload photo including private information.
* share these photo.

So I decided to develop an application for Android storing photo in a local
storage.

What does this application can do?
==================================

This application can

1. take photos.
2. group photos.
3. draw over photos.

All data is stored at /sdcard/.photonote directory.

Requirements
============

screen).
