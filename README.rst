What is this?
=============

This is a photo book application for Android with drawing additional information
onto photo and grouping.

Why did I start to develop this?
================================

One I used Evernote to store photo of my notebook. I had found:

* Paper is good for writing.
* Tablet is good for storing and viewing.

But I do not want to:

* upload photo including private information.
* share these photo.

So I decided to develop an application for Android storing photo in a local
storage.

Requirements
============

The author tested this application on Acer A500 (Android 3.2.1 with 10inch
screen).

.. vim: tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab softtabstop=2 filetype=rst
